# Trailing Zeros 
# Count the number of trailing 0s in the factorial of a given number.



# Input Format

# The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases. It is followed by T lines, each containing an integer N.



# Output Format

# For each test case, print the number of trailing 0s in N!, separated by a new line.



# Constraints

# 1 <= T <= 10000

# 1 <= N <= 1015



# Example

# Input

# 3

# 2

# 5

# 100



# Output

# 0

# 1

# 24



# Explanation



# 2! = 2 [No trailing zeros]

# 5! = 120 [Trailing zeros=1]
